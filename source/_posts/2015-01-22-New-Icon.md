Here we go again with the abruptness of Apple App Store Review process. The update for Delightful was rejected because according to the reviewer it violated the [rule 8.3](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#trademarks-trade-dress):

{% blockquote Apple  https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/  App Store Review Guidelines%}
Apps that appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product, interface, or advertising theme will be rejected.
{% endblockquote %}

Specifically they said Delightful's icon is _confusingly_ similar to the iCloud logo. They didn't have problem when the app was submitted the first time. Now they do. I could argue that Delightful's icon and iCloud are different especially the color. Not to mention that the cloud shape is a [pretty generic cloud icon](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=cloud+icon&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=4sXAVPj8E8WomgXs-4KoBw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1361&bih=673). But from my experience, it is unlikely for Apple Reviewer to change their decision. 

Since I don't want to delay the update any longer, I submitted the update with a new icon. No more cloud shape. Screw the cloud. I'm going with bubbles now. Bubbles are cool.
